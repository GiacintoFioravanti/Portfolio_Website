                    In my software engineering design course, I collaborated with a team of four developers to build a comic book collection system. 
                    It organizes comic books from a CSV file into various categories like author, publisher, volume, and series. 
                    Users can create their own collections, stored in a PostgreSQL database. They can use the app as a guest with limited features or sign in for full access. 
                    All user data is securely stored and accessible upon login. (Janurary 2024 - April 2024)

                    In my Web Engineering course, I created a web app to help nightclubs keep track of customer numbers efficiently. 
                    It made sure they followed safety rules by connecting to a PostgreSQL database, storing maximum and current customer counts for each club. (October 2023 - December 2023)

                 <p>
                    In my free time I engineered a versatile sonar system by integrating Arduino boards and ultrasonic sensors. The system was tailored for seamless attachment to diverse objects upon detection. 
                    This project was programmed using Arduino boards in C++ to accurately record distances and enable customized trigger responses upon object detection. 
                    This project was created to solve the problem of overheating at a desk with a stationary fan, so my first use case was attaching a fan blade to the sonar 
                    which tracks the user and provides constant airflow. (December 2020)
